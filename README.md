## Overview
WICCA is a research-driven framework for investigating how wavelet-based image compression and scaling affect the classification performance of pretrained models. WICCA leverages [Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_wavelet_transform) to generate compressed icons — small representations of images extracted from wavelet decomposition. At the moment, [Haar wavelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet) compression is implemented as the initial method, with extensions to other wavelets planned.


## Project Goals
### Global Goal
- Systematically evaluate how different wavelet compression techniques influence classification across a variety of pretrained models.


### Current Goals
- Analyze how Haar wavelet compression affects classification performance.
- Compare classification results between original high-resolution images and their compressed counterparts.


## How It Works
- Dataset preparation: Large-scale, high-resolution images (≥2K) are sourced.
- Wavelet compression: Haar decomposition is applied to extract representative icons.
- Model inference: Pre-trained CNN classifiers are used to evaluate both original and compressed images.
- Prediction analysis: Performance is compared using top-1 accuracy match, top-5 class intersection, and prediction similarity.
- Results storage: Outcomes are structured in Pandas DataFrames and exported as .csv.


## Core Functionality
✅ Supports high-resolution image datasets.  
✅ Supports multiple CNN architectures.  
✅ Uses pre-trained models: no model training required.  
✅ Enables structured analysis, comparing classification results between original images and their wavelet-compressed counterparts.  
✅ Developed to use in Jupyter Notebook, but can be used as a CLI.
✅ Implemented in a way that it's easy to add a new wavelet.

<details>
      <summary>Imports:</summary>
   
   ```python3
   import os

   import cv2
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import tensorflow.keras.applications as apps
   from pathlib import Path
   
   import wicca.visualization as viz
   import wicca.result_manager as rmgr
   from wicca.data_loader import load_image, load_models
   from wicca.wavelet_coder import HaarCoder
   from wicca.classifying_tools import ClassifierProcessor
   from wicca.config.constants import SIM_CLASSES_PERC, SIM_BEST_CLASS, RESULTS_FOLDER
   ```
   </details>
   

1. Define the models dictionary in the format as in the example, and load it:
   
   ```python3
   models_dict = {
      # Mobile Networks (standard 224×224)
      'MobileNetV2': apps.mobilenet_v2.MobileNetV2,
      # NasNet family (custom shapes)
       'NASNetMobile': apps.nasnet.NASNetMobile,  # Uses 224×224
       'NASNetLarge': (apps.nasnet.NASNetLarge, {'shape': (331, 331)}),
   }
   classifiers = load_models(models_dict)
   ```
3. Define the processor and call it:
   
   ```python3
   processor = ClassifierProcessor(
       data_folder='data/originals',  # Set directory containing images to process
       wavelet_coder=HaarCoder(),  # Set our wavelet
       transform_depth=range(1,6),  # Set the depth of transforming; accepts int | range | list
       top_classes=5,  # Set top classes for comparison
       interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA,  # Set interpolation method
       results_folder='results',  # Set results folder
       log_info=True,  # Print input-related info; enabled by default
       batch_size=30 # Set size of image batch for classifier
   )
   processor.process_classifiers(classifiers, timeout=3600) # timeout for whole process, in seconds
   ```

<!-- Results -->
<details>
   <summary><h2>Results & Insights</h2></summary>
   
   - Haar wavelet compression yields icons that preserve structural features, enabling effective classification.
   - While image size is significantly reduced, essential visual information remains intact.  
   - Compression reduces computational cost but may slightly impact accuracy, depending on the classifier.  
   - Classification accuracy shows model-dependent sensitivity to compression; architectures such as ResNet and NASNet maintain robustness.
